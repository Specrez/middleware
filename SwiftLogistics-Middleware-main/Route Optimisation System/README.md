- **API Type**: RESTful API
- **Primary Functions**:
  - Route optimization calculations
  - Delivery address processing
  - Vehicle availability management
  - Efficient route generation

## Integration
This directory contains the middleware components and configurations needed to integrate with the cloud-based ROS REST API services.

## Files Structure
- `rest-config.json` - REST API configuration
- `api/` - API endpoint definitions and schemas
- `handlers/` - Request/response handlers for ROS integration
